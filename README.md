# Garcia's Game of Life
I am interested in creating another version of conway's game of life in order to examine a theoretical framework I created. 
## The Huilon Theory
A Huilon is a theoretical framework for an idea of a particle beneath Planck's Constant. 
A quark would then be then made of Huilons and forces to move quarks could be researched.
Huilons exist in I space or Imaginary Space. 
Huilons are a Imaginary Topological space. 
the set I of imaginary numbers is the basis of negative space.
## Huilon Axioms
1. Ad Infinitum a huilon never changes shape
2. A huilon can change shape Ad Infinitum
3. Two incident huilons are the same huilon
4. Incidence is a paradox itself, every combination of huilons both exist and don't exist
5. adding huilons evolves the huilon
6. subtracting huilons devolves the huilon
## The Huilon Game of Life
a Huilon will be a shape in IR3 or Imaginary Real 3D Space.
the operation that combines Huilons will be the XOR function on area.
AI will then be trained to trade Huilons with each other.
